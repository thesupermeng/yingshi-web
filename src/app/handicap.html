            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                1.All 1st half bets apply to the first half of play only. Bets are
                settled on the score at the end of the scheduled “45 minutes”
                including injury time.

              <li>
                2.If the match is abandoned, suspended, cancelled or aborted for
                whatsoever reason during the 1st Half, all the first half bets will be
                considered void.)
              </li>
              <li>
                3.If the match is abandoned, suspended, cancelled or aborted for
                whatsoever reason during the 2nd Half or additional periods, all the

              </li>

                2.Settlement is based on the score line, from when the bet was placed
                to the end of the match / period - i.e. the final score minus the
                current score of the match. For 1st Half in-play Handicap bets, this
                is the final score at the end of the 1st Half. For 15 minute period
                in-play Handicap bets, this is the final score at the end of the 15
                minute period.
