      </li>
      <li>
        3.The stronger team will give the ball to the weaker team. The outcome is
        determined by the official result plus the handicap. The number of
        handicap is an integer.For example one ball, two balls, three balls, etc.
        You can predict the home team win, draw or away team according to the
        adjusted result.
      </li>
      <li>
        4.Let the home and away teams have a (-) or (+) sign after the team name.
      </li>
      <li>
        for example
        <ul>
          <br  />
          <li>
            a.Barcelona (-1) indicates the handicap team, and the following number
            indicates the number of handicap, e.g. -1 means 1 handicap
          </li>
          <li>
            b.A draw (-1) means the home team has a handicap, and the following
            number indicates the number of handicap, for example -1 means 1
            handicap
          </li>
          <li>
            c.Espanyol (+1) means the assigned team, and the following numbers
            indicate the number of assignments, e.g. +1 means assigning 1 goal
          </li>
          <li>
            d.According to the result after calculating the handicap to judge the
            victory, for example, in the picture above [Barcelona] handicap 1 ball
            to [Spanish],The whole game result is 1:1. The result after the
            handicap adjustment only needs to add one goal to the [España] team,
            and the one goal won by the [Barcelona] team remains
            unchanged.Therefore, the adjusted result is 1:2, so the bet on
            [Spanish] + 1 wins.
