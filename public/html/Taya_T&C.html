        The account holder knows and accepts that all odds and market lines are

        the member's betting at that time.

        Multiple bets placed on the same event at the same time will not be
        recognized.

        TAYA has the final decision on any related betting and transactions.

        The account holder fully accepts the random shuffling of the system
        software in the poker game, and accept other random game transactions.

        The account holder agrees and accepts that WAP network links are not
        always stable. The company only recognizes the bets recorded in the
        system, and TAYA is not responsible for any misplaced bets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unless listed either in conjunction with the bet offer, or else in the
        Sport Specific rules, all bets should be considered valid for the result
        at the end of the "Regular Time" or "Full Time" only. "Regular Time" or
        "Full time" is defined as interpreted by the official rules published by
        the respective governing association. For example, in Football, full
        time is stipulated to be 90 minutes including injury time. Should the
        governing association decide to stipulate, before the start of the
        event, that the said event is to be played over a different duration,
        this will be treated as being the official rules for the event (for
        example, football matches played with 3 x 30 minutes or 2 x 40 minute
        formats). Nonetheless, such occurrence is limited to the "regular"
        playing time and does not include any prolongation such as extra time or
        overtime, unless explicitly stated.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Livebetting" is where it is possible to bet during an ongoing match or
        event. TAYA does not acknowledge or accept any liability whatsoever if
        it not possible to place a bet or the live score update is not correct.
        At all times, it is the Account Holder's responsibility to be aware of
        the match and the events surrounding it, such as the current score, its
        progression and how much time remains before the match is completed.
        TAYA does not accept any liability for changes to the Livebetting
        schedule or interruption of the Livebetting service.

      <li>
        Whenever there's evidence of fraud, game-fixing or rigging, TAYA

      measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing
      are commensurate to the identified risks. This will allow resources to be
      allocated in the most efficient ways. The principle is that resources
      should be directed in accordance with priorities so that the greatest

      benefits originated from a legitimate source. Generally, money laundering
      is composed of three (3) stages involving several transactions which could
      alert an intermediary such as the Company to the money laundering
